<h2>Physics Week 2 Questions </h2>
<div class="question">
  <p><strong>Advanced:</strong> Define density and explain how it is calculated. Provide the formula.</p>
  <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> Density is the mass per unit volume. Formula: Density = Mass / Volume</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
  <p><strong>Advanced:</strong> A cube has a mass of 120 grams and a side length of 4 centimeters. Calculate its density.</p>
  <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> Use the formula: Density = Mass / Volume: ans = 1.875 grams/cm³</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
  <p><strong>Advanced:</strong> Explain the concept of pressure in physics and provide its formula.</p>
  <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> Pressure is force applied perpendicular to the surface divided by the area over which the force is distributed. Formula: Pressure = Force / Area</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
  <p><strong>Advanced:</strong> A force of 500 Newtons is applied to an area of 2 square meters. Calculate the pressure exerted.</p>
  <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> Use the formula: Pressure = Force / Area: ans = 250 Pascals </p>
</div>

<div class="question">
  <p><strong>Advanced:</strong> A cylinder contains 5 liters of gas at a pressure of 3 atmospheres. If the volume is reduced to 2 liters, what will be the new pressure?</p>
  <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> Use Boyle's Law: Pressure1 × Volume1 = Pressure2 × Volume2: ans = 7.5 atm</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
  <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> A substance has a density of 2.5 grams per cubic centimeter. What is its density in kilograms per cubic meter?</p>
  <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> Convert grams to kilograms and centimeters to meters to find the density in kg/m³.: ans = 0.0025 kg/cm³.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
  <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> A hydraulic lift has a small piston with an area of 20 square centimeters and a large piston with an area of 200 square centimeters. If a force of 500 Newtons is applied to the small piston, what force will be exerted by the large piston?</p>
  <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> Use the principle of Pascal's law: Pressure applied to an enclosed fluid is transmitted undiminished to all portions of the fluid.: ans =5 000 N.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
  <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> An object has a weight of 500 Newtons and is placed on a table with a surface area of 0.5 square meters. Calculate the pressure exerted by the object on the table.</p>
  <p><span class="answer">Answer:</span> Use the formula: Pressure = Force / Area: ans = 1000 Pascals (Pa)</p>
